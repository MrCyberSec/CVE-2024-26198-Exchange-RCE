## Description
It seems there are Exchange patches almost every month now, and March is no different. This bug is a classic DLL loading vulnerability. An attacker places a specially crafted file in a location they control. They then entice a user to open the file, which loads the crafted DLL and leads to code execution. Last month, Microsoft stated the Exchange bug was being actively exploited only after the release. This bug is currently NOT listed as exploited in the wild, but Iâ€™ll update this blog should Microsoft change its mind (again).
